        Step-by-Step Breakdown:<br>
Initial Values:
<br>
a = 2<br>
b = 1<br>
First Operation: --a<br>

The --a is a pre-decrement operator. This means the value of a is decremented before being used in the expression.<br>

Decrement a first: a becomes 1 (since a was initially 2).<br>
Result: --a evaluates to 1.<br>
Now:<br>

a = 1<br>
b = 1<br>
Second Operation: --b<br>

The --b is also a pre-decrement operator. It will decrement b before being used.<br>

Decrement b first: b becomes 0 (since b was initially 1).<br>
Result: --b evaluates to 0.<br>
Now:<br>

a = 1<br>
b = 0<br>
Third Operation: ++b<br>

The ++b is a pre-increment operator. It increments b first before being used in the expression.<br>

Increment b first: b becomes 1 (since b was 0).<br>
Result: ++b evaluates to 1.<br>
Now:<br>

a = 1<br>
b = 1<br>
Fourth Operation: b--<br>

The b-- is a post-decrement operator. This means the current value of b is used in the expression, and then b is decremented after that.<br>

Use b value first: b is 1 (since b is currently 1).<br>
After the operation: b becomes 0 after being used.<br>
Now:<br>

a = 1<br>
b = 0<br>
